## My process

I did 4 things:

1. I started off by writing the HTML. 

2. After that, I wrote the CSS.

3. Then I proceeded to learn how to use Git by struggling and muddling through it with the help of Google and Git's documentation. 

4. And then, I deployed the site using Netflify.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox




### What I learned

* I learned that development is a land full of frustration. Things won't work well but just like a builder in the real world, I have to gather up what resources I have and use them to build what I have regardless. Less bitching. More doing and cracking my brain till I figure it out.

* This code below helped me figure out how to create an image overlay. I'm just gonna keep it here as a reference for whenever I need to remember it. 

```.image-container {
    position: relative;
    margin-top: 20px;

}

.image-container .after {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 98%;
    display: none;
    color: #fff;
    transition: all 1s ease-in;
}
```

* I also got to work on media queries and while they aren't perfect yet, I'm definitely moving forward.



### Continued development

I plan to focus more on positioning with CSS, using CSS flexbox and the media queries. I'm also learning Javascript at the moment so things are probably about to get a bit more fun.

## Acknowledgments

Well, asides from the many websites I found through Google, StackOverflow and Google itself, I guess I have to give myself a pat on the back because I ran through many problems but stuck with this project and eventually, after weeks, I got it done. Hopefully, the next one would be smoother.
